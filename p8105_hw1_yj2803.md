day, dewp, hour, humid, month, origin, precip, pressure, temp,
time_hour, visib, wind_dir, wind_gust, wind_speed, year  
It has 358 rows and 15 columns.  
The mean temperature (temp) in this dataset is 39.58°F.

The scatterplot shows that temperatures fluctuate within a day and tend
to increase toward mid-January. Humidity seems to tend to decrease as
temperatures increase and increase as temperatures go down. However, a
few days of generally high humidity were observed at the end of the
second week of January.
