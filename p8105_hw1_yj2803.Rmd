# Problem 1
```{r data, results='hide'}
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather") # data set in moderndive library
```

The dataset "early_january_weather" contains the following variables:  
`r ls(early_january_weather)`  
It has `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns.  
The mean temperature (temp) in this dataset is `r round(mean(early_january_weather$temp), digits = 2)`Â°F.


```{r scatter, cache=T}
library(ggplot2)
scatter_temp_hour <- early_january_weather %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid)) + # color points using the humid variable
  geom_point(size=2) 
scatter_temp_hour
```
